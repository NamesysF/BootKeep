# BootKeep
A program to support the performance of a Telegram bot.


# installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/namesysf/botkeep
```
```bash
cd BotKeep
```
```bash
bash botkeep.sh
```


# How it works?
The program runs the "nohup python botname.py" command 100 times, which allows the bot to work even when you do not have an Internet connection.
